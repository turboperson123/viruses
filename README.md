viruses that i made myself, i don't recommend executing the viruses if you don't know what it does

1. gta-san-andreas-downloader.exe
this is a fake downloader in which it deletes malwarebytes.
Once the virus is executed it starts putting stage text files in which the downloading process of gta is at, 
Once it exceeds 100 percent, then it starts ending malwarebytes services, and deleting malwarebytes of the computer.
there is a bug with this in the code which the % sign dosen't work, so if you just see 25,50,75,100 on there then thats the downloading process.
Warning (x64) means for 64 bit windows, (x86) means for 32 bit windows
